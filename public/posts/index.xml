      <description>&lt;p&gt;As discussed in &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/ipv6-mostly-home-intro/&#34;&gt;the previous post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, I am currently making some modifications to my homelab. As a part of this process, I am looking at NAT64 solutions again. I am currently running Tayga on OpnSense, but want to move to NAT64 with a dedicated VM. This post will be going through what NAT64 is, how clients interact with it, a comparison of different implementations and finally setting up my chosen implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Experimenting With Srv6 VPN services Over The Internet</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since learning about SRv6, I have been interested in testing how SRv6-based VPN services work, especially over an uncontrolled network like the Internet. I happened to have some time and energy to play around with it. This post doesn&amp;rsquo;t describe a production-ready setup; it&amp;rsquo;s just some notes from playing around and figuring out what is possible, how it works, and getting some ideas for future tinkering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-segment-routing-and-srv6&#34;&gt;What is Segment routing and SRv6?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Segment routing is a modern approach to directing traffic. It works over either IPv6 or MPLS, and has many interesting features related to redundancy, traffic engineering, and services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Glimpse into the Future: An introduction to IPv6 in your homelab</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-should-ipv6-be-a-part-of-a-homelab&#34;&gt;Why Should IPv6 be a part of a homelab?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been a long-time advocate for IPv6. It has been a crucial part of my homelab for years, and through my work at a major Danish ISP, I&amp;rsquo;ve have among other things contributed to enabling and improving IPv6 for many Danish broadband customers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;m currently updating and fine-tuning some aspects of my homelab, I thought it would be a good idea to document the process here. This will serve as not only personal documentation but also an introduction for anyone interested in setting up their own IPv6 homelab.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
