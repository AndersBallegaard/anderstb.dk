      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been a long-time advocate for IPv6. It has been a crucial part of my homelab for years, and through my work at a major Danish ISP, I&amp;rsquo;ve have among other things contributed to enabling and improving IPv6 for many Danish broadband customers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;m currently updating and fine-tuning some aspects of my homelab, I thought it would be a good idea to document the process here. This will serve as not only personal documentation but also an introduction for anyone interested in setting up their own IPv6 homelab.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
