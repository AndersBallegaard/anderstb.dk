      <description>&lt;p&gt;As discussed in &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/ipv6-mostly-home-intro/&#34;&gt;the previous post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, I am currently making some modifications to my homelab. As a part of this process, I am looking at NAT64 solutions again. I am currently running Tayga on OpnSense, but want to move to NAT64 with a dedicated VM. This post will be going through what NAT64 is, how clients interact with it, a comparison of different implementations and finally setting up my chosen implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-should-ipv6-be-a-part-of-a-homelab&#34;&gt;Why Should IPv6 be a part of a homelab?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been a long-time advocate for IPv6. It has been a crucial part of my homelab for years, and through my work at a major Danish ISP, I&amp;rsquo;ve have among other things contributed to enabling and improving IPv6 for many Danish broadband customers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;m currently updating and fine-tuning some aspects of my homelab, I thought it would be a good idea to document the process here. This will serve as not only personal documentation but also an introduction for anyone interested in setting up their own IPv6 homelab.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
